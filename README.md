# ScrabbleHelper
Python code working as a Scrabble Helper for the famous game 'Scrabble'.


This script takes help from nltk.corpus package and retrieves words from it.

We take a set of input words from user that is mainly the available words for scrabble. For any guess word we employ a '?' as a reference.

In return the script outputs the set of all words that can be formed by input characters in descending order of their length because obviously one would want to get the longest word first ;).
